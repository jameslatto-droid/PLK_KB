# Project Overview & Vision

## 1. Intent

The PLK_KB project exists to provide a **single, trusted knowledge platform** for engineering, design, commercial, and analytical information held across the organisation.

It prioritises **control, traceability, and long-term maintainability** over convenience or novelty.

---

## 2. In-Scope Information

- Engineering reports and specifications
- Design documentation
- Calculations and analysis
- Proposals and commercial submissions
- Costing spreadsheets
- Internal knowledge base material
- 2D technical drawings (PDF, DWG/DXF)
- 3D models (STEP/IGES and exported metadata)

---

## 3. Users & Usage Pattern

- Approx. 10 internal users
- Occasional, non-continuous use
- Low concurrency
- Mixed technical and management audience

---

## 4. Design Philosophy

The platform is designed around the following beliefs:

- Knowledge must be **discoverable**, not memorised
- Answers must be **defensible**, not plausible
- AI must be **constrained**, not creative
- Systems must be **rebuildable**, not fragile

---

## 5. Non-Goals

This project does not aim to:

- Replace CAD or engineering tools
- Perform autonomous engineering judgement
- Interpret geometry as a human designer would
- Act as a public or customer-facing AI system
