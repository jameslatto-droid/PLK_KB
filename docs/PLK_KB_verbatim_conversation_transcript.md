## User
i amlooking for effective ways to index large amnounts of data for use with an LLM

## User
suggest a good stack strategy for me. i have 1tb of technical engineering, desig, calculations, papers, proposals, costing sheets, knowledge base etc. in my company and i want to be able to run document search, contextual searches and also compile for analysis any type of data. I will create a portal for all of the seach functionality but want to setup the backend first. lets go with a modular solution if possible so we can keep thisngs oordered and tidy
