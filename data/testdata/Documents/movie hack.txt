Magma presentation - continued reference to petrobras for a qualification program as well as a flowline pilot for them to 'get used' to M-pipe

Mentioned that the project has already been agreed & that all they are waiting for is funding from petrobras

Discussed that there are regular meetings with CENPES team and that a full 3 day FMECA workshop was carried out

Generally it was relatively high level and not a great presentation example

i had the impression he did not beleive what he was saying
